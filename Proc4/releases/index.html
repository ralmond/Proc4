    This web site will eventual host three projects related to the
    infrastructure of <i>Physics Playground</i>.  The framework is
    build the four-process architecture of Almond, Steinberg, and
    Mislevy (2002).

  Almond, R. G., Steinberg, L. S., and Mislevy, R.J. (2002).</a>  Enhancing

  </p>
  <h1>Proc4</h1>
  <p>
    This generally handles messages from the four process
    architecture.  It also handles logging to databases and recovery
    of messages from databases.

    Code is not yet released, but the subversion repository is at:
    <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/Proc4/">

  </p>
  <h1>EIEvent (Evidence Identification by Event)</h1>
  <p>
    This is a rule based system for processing event logs to produce
    observables. A draft <a href="RulesOfEvidence.pdf">document</a> of
    the rule format and logic is available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code is not yet released, but the subversion repository is at:
    <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/EIEvent/">
      https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/EIEvent/</a>
  </p>
  <p>
     I gave a talk about this at the Maryland Assessment Research
     Center (MARC) conference. You can download the <a
     href="https://education.umd.edu/file/11333/download?token=kmOIVIwi">slides</a>
     or view a <a href="Almond-Marc18.mp4">video</a> (warning 1.6 MB).


  <h1>EABN (Evidence Accumulation using Bayes Nets)</h1>
  <p>
    This handles evidence accumulation using Bayesian networks.
    It uses <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/RNetica">RNetica</a>
    for its Bayes net engine.
  </p>

    Code is not yet released, but the subversion repository is at:

    <h1>User Survey</h1>

<p>
We will add a user survey when this is completed.  Please stop by to
fill it out.

<h2> Sponsorship Information </h2>

<p>
Work on the Proc4, EIEvent and EABN packages has been supported by
the National Science
foundation grant <i>DIP: Game-based Assessment and Support of
  STEM-related Competencies</i> (#1628937, Val Shute, PI). The tool
development parts of this projects was led by <a
