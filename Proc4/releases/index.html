    This web site will eventuall host three projects related to the
    infrastructure of <i>Physics Playground</i>.
  </p>
  <h1>Proc4</h1>
  <p>
    This generally handles messages from the four process
    architecture.  It also handles logging to databases and recovery
    of messages from databases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code is not yet released, but the subverions repository is at:
    <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/Proc4/">
      https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/Proc4/</a>
  </p>
  <h1>EIEvent</h1>
  <p>
    This is a rule based system for processing event logs to produce
    observables. A draft <a href="RulesOfEvidence.pdf">document</a> of
    the rule format and logic is available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code is not yet released, but the subverions repository is at:
    <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/EIEvent/">
      https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/EIEvent/</a>
  </p>
  <h1>EABN</h1>
  <p>
    This handles evidence accumulation using Bayesian networks.
    It uses <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/RNetica">RNetica</a>
    for its Bayes net engine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code is not yet released, but the subverions repository is at:
    <a href="https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/EABN/">
      https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/svn/common/EABN/</a>
  </p>
  
    <h1>User Survey</h1>

<p>
We will add a user survey when this is completed.  Please stop by to
fill it out.
</p>

<h2> RSS Feed</h2>
<p>After learning that people were scraping my site looking for new
releases, I've added an RSS feed.  The link
is <a href="Proc4RSS.xml">Proc4RSS</a>.
</p>

<h2> Sponsorship Information </h2>

<p>
Work on the Proc4, EIEvent and EABN packages has been supported by
the National Science
foundation grant <i>DIP: Game-based Assessment and Support of
  STEM-related Competencies</i> (#1628937, Val Shute, PI). The tool
development parts of this projects was ledby <a href="mailto:ralmond@fsu.edu">Russell Almond </a>.
