	to forked strategy, using both (un)serializeJSON and
	parseSimpleData.

	* R/Message.R (saveRec): Added names of "oid" to "_id" field, so
	it gets automagically processed by buildJQuery.
	(parseData, unparseData): Changed the way this works so it now
	uses (un)serializeJSON to do the work.

	* R/Message.R (unboxer): Changed so that it would not "unbox"
	vectors of length greater than 1.
	(parseData): Changed so that it wouldn't do numeric/character
	conversion if there were lists of length greater than 1.
