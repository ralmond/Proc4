	* R/Listeners.R (buildListener): Need basename here, as we don't want the full URL-like app name.

2020-06-12  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* inst/config/setupApps.js: New code for setting up new
	configuration for AuthorizedApps collection.

	* R/Message.R (getManyRecs): Bug in getManyRecs (sort vs sorts).

	shiny list.
	

2020-04-26  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Listeners.R (listenerName):  Changed funciton name and name is
	too likely to cause conflicts.

	* R/Listeners.R (resetListeners):  Added reset method.

	* R/Message.R (m_id<-,context<-,timestamp<-):  Added setter
	methods.
	

2020-04-20  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Listeners.R (buildListener): Added this function to build a
	listener from JSON specifications.

2020-04-04  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Message.R (markAsProcessed): stupid missing ! causing infinite
	loop.  Fixed test to die on excessive loops.

2020-03-17  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Message.R (makeDBuri): Moved this code here as it seems to be
	used just about every time we make a mongo connetion.
	(makeDBuri): Added protocol arguement

	* R/Listeners.R (ListenerSet): Added trap for blank URI to make
	no-Mongo version.

2020-02-19  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Message.R (ununboxer): using sapply instead of lapply in
	ununboxer causes it to simplify lists of length one in strange
	ways.  Can I change sapply to lapply here?  NO.  This breaks lots
	of other things.

2020-02-12  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Message.R (saveRec, markAsProcessed, markAsError): Changed so
	that these would not save if the col argument is NULL.

2019-12-20  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	messages to avoid quoting issues in Mongo.

2019-07-17  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Listeners.R (TableListener): Added TableListener.  

2019-07-02  Russell Almond  <ralmond@macox.com>

	* R/Message.R (cleanMessageJlist): Added check for cases {$oid:
	xxx} and {$data:YYYY-MM-DD...} (mongo export rather than using
	as.json). 

2019-06-19  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Message.R (cleanMessageJlist): Added a trim to the context.
	Hopefully, this will get rid of stray whitespace issues.
	(as.jlist(P4Message)): Changed to make pError always a string, as
	we can't seem to get error when we try to save the object.

2019-05-12  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Listeners.R (UpsertListener): Added context to the list of
	fields it updates, as this is particularly useful for the
	Statistics collection, but not bad for the Players collection.

2019-04-27  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Message.R (P4Message-class):  Added boolean "processed"
	field. 

2019-03-06  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	can surpress id and timestamp checks when needed.

2019-02-24  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Listeners.R (CaptureListener): Added class to be used for
	testing. 

2019-02-02  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Listeners.R (MongoDB, ListenerSet): Changed protocol on
	ListenerSet, so that connection to the DB is established when
	$messdb() method is called, rather than on initialize.

2019-01-13  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/Listeners.R: Added listener objects similar to Java listener
	paradigm. 

2018-12-31  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/Message.R (parseSimpleData, parseData, unparseData): Changed
	to forked strategy, using both (un)serializeJSON and
	parseSimpleData. 
	(parseSimpleData, ununboxer): Handling for NULL feilds

2018-12-27  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/Message.R (saveRec): Added names of "oid" to "_id" field, so
	it gets automagically processed by buildJQuery.
	(parseData, unparseData): Changed the way this works so it now
	uses (un)serializeJSON to do the work.

2018-12-24  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Limu>

	* R/Message.R (unboxer): Changed so that it would not "unbox"
	vectors of length greater than 1.
	(parseData): Changed so that it wouldn't do numeric/character
	conversion if there were lists of length greater than 1.

	unboxer recursive model.
