  Abstract                 = {When populations are cross-classified with respect to two or more classifications or polytomies, questions often arise about the degree of association existing between the several polytomies. Most of the traditional measures or indices of association are based upon the standard chi-square statistic or on an assumption of underlying joint normality. In this paper a number of alternative measures are considered, almost all based upon a probabilistic model for activity to which the cross-classification may typically lead. Only the case in which the population is completely known is considered, so no question of sampling or measurement error appears. We hope, however, to publish before long some approximate distributions for sample estimators of the measures we propose, and approximate tests of hypotheses. Our major theme is that the measures of association used by an empirical investigator should not be blindly chosen because of tradition and convention only, although these factors may properly be given some weight, but should be constructed in a manner having operational meaning within the context of the particular problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian networks are frequently used in educational assessments primarily for learning about students' knowledge and skills. There is a lack of works on assessing fit of Bayesian networks. This article employs the posterior predictive model checking method, a popular Bayesian model checking tool, to assess fit of simple Bayesian networks. A number of aspects of model fit, those of usual interest to practitioners, are assessed using various diagnostic tools. This article suggests a direct data display for assessing overall fit, suggests several diagnostics for assessing item fit, suggests a graphical approach to examine if the model can explain the association among the items, and suggests a version of the Mantel-Haenszel statistic for assessing differential item functioning. Limited simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested model diagnostics.}

  Abstract                 = {User modelling shells and learner modelling servers have been proposed in order to provide reusable user/student model information over different domains, common inference mechanisms, and mechanisms to handle consistency of beliefs from different sources. Open and inspectable student models have been investigated by several authors as a means to promote student reflection, knowledge awareness, collaborative assessment, self-assessment, interactive diagnosis, to arrange groups of students, and to support the use of students' models by the teacher. This paper presents SModel, a Bayesian student modelling server used in distributed multi-agent environments. SModel server includes a student model database and a Bayesian student modelling component. SModel provides several services to a group of agents in a CORBA platform. Users can use ViSMod, a Bayesian student modelling visualization tool, and SMV, a student modelling database viewer, to visualize and inspect distributed Bayesian student models maintained by SModel server. SModel has been tested in a multi-agent tutoring system for teaching basic Java programming. In addition, SModel server has been used to maintain and share student models in a study focussed on exploring the existence of student reflection and analysing student model accuracy using inspectable Bayesian student models.
